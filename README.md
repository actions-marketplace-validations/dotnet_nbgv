# GitHub Action for Nerdbank.GitVersioning

[![GitHub Actions status](https://github.com/dotnet/nbgv/workflows/CI/PR/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dotnet/nbgv/actions)

This action installs the CLI for [Nerdbank.GitVersioning](https://github.com/AArnott/Nerdbank.GitVersioning)
and exposes version data from it as action outputs.
It optionally also sets environment variables.

âŒš The action runs in about 5 seconds.

This project is supported by the [.NET Foundation](https://dotnetfoundation.org).

## Inputs

All inputs are optional.

|Name|Default|Description
|--|--|--|
`path`|Repo root|The path to the directory for which the version should be determined. This should be at or below the directory containing the version.json file.
`setCommonVars`|false|Defines a few common version variables as environment variables, with a "Git" prefix (e.g. GitBuildVersion, GitBuildVersionSimple, GitAssemblyInformationalVersion). Adds the `--common-vars` switch to the `nbgv cloud` command.
`setAllVars`|false|Defines ALL version variables as environment variables, with a "NBGV_" prefix. Adds the `--all-vars` switch to the `nbgv cloud` command.
`stamp`||The path to a file whose version setting should be changed to match the computed version. Supported file types: `package.json`
`toolVersion`|latest stable|The version of the nbgv dotnet CLI tool to install and use. If not specified, the default is the latest stable version.

GitCommitDate|The date of the git commit at HEAD
VersionHeight|The number of commits in the longest single path between the specified commit and the most distant ancestor (inclusive) that set the version to the value at HEAD.
VersionHeightOffset|The offset to add to VersionHeight when calculating the BuildNumber or wherever else the VersionHeight is used.
Version|The four integer version.
BuildMetadataFragment|The +metadata portion of the version, if any.
NuGetPackageVersion|The version to be used for NuGet packages.

## Example usage

In each example below, replace the `master` branch reference in `@master` with the latest versioned branch available at the time you consume it.
This will help your consumption be stable even as we (may) make breaking changes.
You can always unlock new features in the Action by bumping the `v0.x` to v0.x+1 later.

### Using step outputs

```yaml
- uses: dotnet/nbgv@master
  id: nbgv
- run: echo 'SemVer2=${{ steps.nbgv.outputs.SemVer2 }}'
```

### Using environment variables

```yaml
- uses: dotnet/nbgv@master
  with:
    setAllVars: true
- run: echo "NBGV_SemVer2 $NBGV_SemVer2"
```

### Stamp the version on a package.json file

```yaml
- uses: dotnet/nbgv@master
  with:
    stamp: package.json
```

## Checkout requirements

Git history based versioning tools rely on history being included in the clone.
`actions/checkout@v1` does this by default.
But if you're using `actions/checkout@v2` you'll need to specify deep clone:

```yml
- uses: actions/checkout@v2
  with:
    fetch-depth: 0 # avoid shallow clone so nbgv can do its work.
```
